# Dependency Fix Applied

## ✅ Fixed

**Issue**: `supercharged ^2.4.0` doesn't exist
**Fix**: Changed to `supercharged: ^2.1.1` (latest compatible version)

## 🚀 Next Step

Run:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

This should work now!

## 📋 If Other Packages Fail

If you see more dependency errors, we can:
1. Check each package version
2. Update to compatible versions
3. Remove unused packages if needed

**Try `flutter pub get` again!**
