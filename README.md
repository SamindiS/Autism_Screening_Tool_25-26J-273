## 📌 Project Overview

**SenseAI** is a **research-grade, AI-powered early screening system for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** designed for children aged **2–6 years**.
The system integrates **four clinically motivated behavioral screening components**, each developed independently and collaboratively by team members, into a **single unified platform**.

SenseAI focuses on **objective, child-friendly, culturally adapted, and scalable screening**, particularly suitable for **low-resource healthcare environments in Sri Lanka**.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** SenseAI is a **screening and research tool only**. It does **not** provide medical diagnosis. All results must be reviewed by qualified healthcare professionals.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Existing ASD screening methods face major limitations:

* Late diagnosis (commonly after age 4)
* High reliance on subjective clinician observation
* Limited access to trained specialists
* Lack of culturally adapted digital tools
* Poor engagement for very young children
* Mostly English-only assessment instruments

These issues delay early intervention and reduce equitable access to screening.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution

SenseAI addresses these challenges through:

* 🎮 **Gamified, age-appropriate assessments**
* 📊 **Objective behavioral and cognitive metrics**
* 🤖 **Machine-learning-based risk scoring**
* 🌍 **Multilingual support (English, Sinhala, Tamil)**
* 🔌 **Offline-first system architecture**
* 📱 **Tablet-optimized, child-friendly UI**

---

## 🧩 System Components (Collaborative Development)

SenseAI consists of **four integrated screening modules**, each developed in a **separate Git branch** to demonstrate collaboration and independent contribution.

### 🧠 Component 1: Cognitive Flexibility & Rule Switching

**Developer:** Sankalpani M.H.S (IT22128904)

* DCCS (Color–Shape rule switching)
* Go/No-Go inhibitory control
* Reaction time & switch-cost analysis
* ML-based ASD risk classification

---

### 👁️ Component 2: Visual Attention & Gaze Tracking

**Developer:** Karunathilaka S.M

* Camera-based eye-tracking
* Eye Calibration
* Butterfly Chase & Bubble Pop games
* Fixation, saccade & attention metrics
* Gradient Boosting classifier trained on clinical data

---

### 🎧 Component 3: Auditory Response to Name (RTN)

**Developer:** Ilanganthilake I.M.H

* Audio-visual analysis of name-calling response
* Head turn, eye movement & response latency detection
* Non-invasive, home-based screening workflow
* ML-based risk scoring

---

### 🔁 Component 4: Restricted & Repetitive Behaviors (RRBs)

**Developer:** Senavirathna K.G.G.K

* Video-based motor behavior analysis
* Pose estimation + CNN-LSTM deep learning model
* Detection of repetitive movement patterns
* Multi-class RRB classification with confidence scores
